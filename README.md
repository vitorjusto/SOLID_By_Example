# SOLID-By-Example
Welcome to this repository dedicated to learning and applying the SOLID principles through practical, real-life code examples.
Here you'll find legacy anti-pattern code and refactored versions, making it easy to understand the before/after impact of proper software design.

Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, this repo is a valuable reference for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable software.
